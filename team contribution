We collaboratively selected the project theme and formulated the research problem. 
Asteria focused on writing the Introduction of the project while Yufei contributed to the Literature Review.

We performed model implementation and data analysis individually for our respective sections. 
Specifically, we each handled preprocessing of the dataset independently. 
Then Asteria was responsible for the ARIMA model and the BSTS model using the bsts package, including their implementation, results and discussion;
while Yufei focused on the BSTS model using the stan package, conducting the coding, analysis and interpretation for that part.

Throughout the project, we met and went to office hour regularly to align our progress and integrate our work into a cohesive final report.
